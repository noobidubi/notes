## Basic use
`nmap [target IP]`
 
 - `-sV`: _show Version_
 - `-sC`: _safe Scripts_
 - `-p22,80`: only scans port 22 and 80(`-p-`: _scan all ports_)
 - `-oN filename`: output the .nmap file
 - `-O`: OS detection _requires sudo priveleges_
 - `-A`: Aggressive scan _may get detected_

## Advanced options

_most require **sudo priveleges**_
 
 - `--script [script//script category]`: uses a _script_ or a _script category_
 - `-D RND:5`: uses 5 random decoy IP's
 - `-n`: disables DNS resolution
 - `-g53`: uses a different source port _useful for DNS servers_
 - `-e tun0`: uses specified network interface

## Script category's
can be used with `--script [category]`
