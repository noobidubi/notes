The **APK** file format is a format used to distribute and install *mostly* Android Apps, games or Middleware. You can compare APK to formats like .deb, .deb just being the Debian equivalent to APK.

# Reversing APK
You have two options when reversing an APK you can either do **Static Analysis** or **Active Analysis**. When doing **Static Analysis** you try to unzip and decompile the app without running it to get a look at the code, metadata and much more, but with this method you can't find everything. With **Active Analysis** you can find a lot more because you're running the app directly in a VM or mobile device having access to logs, API calls, etc.

## Passive Analysis
maybe later...
